Problem Statement : 

We have an array input_array[0 . . . n-1]. We should be able to
1 Find the sum of elements from index l to r where 0 <= l <= r <= n-1(if(s>=mod)s=s%mod, where mod is 1000000007)

2 Change value of a specified element of the array to a new value x. We need to do arr[i] = x where 0 <= i <= n-1.
