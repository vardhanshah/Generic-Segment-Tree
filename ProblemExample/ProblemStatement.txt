Problem Statement : 

We have an array array[1 . . . n], where n is number of elements in array. We should be able to

1 Find the sum s of elements from index l to r where 1 <= l <= r <= n
(if(s>=mod)s=s%mod, where mod is 1000000007)
Print in following manner "range [l,r] : s"(without quotes).

2 Change value of a specified element of the array to a new value x. We need to do arr[i] = x where 1 <= i <= n.

Solution :

CreateTestCase.cpp 			- file shows how input test case generated.

SegmentTreeProgam.cpp 		- file shows the solution using Segment Tree approach for the problem
BruteForceProgram.cpp 		- file shows the solution using Brute Force approach for the problem

[Both above program shows output as describe in problem, and at the end shows the time is taken by both program.]

Input.txt					- file shows the input for the 
SegmentTreeProgamOutput.txt - file shows the output of SegmentTreeProgram.cpp
BruteForceProgramOutput.txt - file shows the output of BruteForceProgram.cpp 

diff.patch            		- file shows the difference between SegmentTreeProgamOutput.txt and BruteForceProgramOutput.txt
(difference being the taken time from above program)
